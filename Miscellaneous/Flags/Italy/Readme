Alternative flags when you form Italy with Lombardia/Venice/Tuscany/Two Sicilies
Rename the flag to ITA_monarchy and replace the file in Victoria 2/mod/BAI/gfx/flags folder. Make sure to backup the original file before doing that.
Delete the flag cache if it doesn't show up in Documents and Settings/Paradox Interactive/Victoria II/BAI/gfx
